Decryption code for the puzzle released on 2018/11/30 on https://forums.galaxy-of-heroes.starwars.ea.com.

Thanks to:
----------

* jeffnorth86, Mrtops, CrimsonBadger, and NaFakCha for noticing important clues;
* newershadow piecing it all together;
* and CG_SBCrumb for the mind-melting codes within codes.

Why do a thing?
---------------

I wrote this script because the https://www.wmich.edu/mus-theo/solfa-cipher/ website did not seem to work for me - it seems to ignore the integers - and it counts differently to newershadow's solution, using 4 instead of 0. I could see part of how newershadow got there but the disconnect was frustrating me.
 
Besides, at the end of running this, you will end up with a neat little icon!

Instructions
------------

1. Download the input file from https://goo.gl/4HXR42 as "madness.jpg"
1. Run this script in the same directory
1. Pick up your sweet-ass new icon ("answer.png")
